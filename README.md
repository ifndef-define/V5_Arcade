## About this Project
After randomly coming accross this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exjGBy4SHME) and seeing Doom being emulated on the Vex Brain, I had an idea to create a library of games for the Vex Brain for absolutly no reason at all. Doing anything but Vex related things during a meeting or during a competition seemed the right thing to do, so I made this project. Enjoy!
